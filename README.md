Tetris (Russian: Тетрис)[a] is a puzzle video game created by Soviet software engineer Alexey Pajitnov in 1984. <br>
It has been published by several companies for multiple platforms, most prominently during a dispute over the appropriation  <br>
of the rights in the late 1980s. After a significant period of publication by Nintendo, the rights reverted to Pajitnov in 1996,  <br>
who co-founded the Tetris Company with Henk Rogers to manage licensing.<br>
